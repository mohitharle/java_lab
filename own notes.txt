 diff btwn variables & methods
 

variable
a)it is a container which stores multiple values like 10,10.0,true,"mohit",'m',etc..
  
methods
a)a method is identified by its action which can perform any type of action and hold the properties like eat,dance,etc.

  1)argumented 
  here we pass something in paranthesis(i like singing)
  2)non argumented
  where paranthesis is empty
  
  1)static
  which is call by class name and static keyword is with method
  2)non static
  there is no static keyword, and we need to create new object
